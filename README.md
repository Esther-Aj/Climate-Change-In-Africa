# Climate Change In Africa
This report analyzes the state of climate change in Africa. It provides insights on the impact of climate change on African regions (with four countries, one from each African region, as case studies).

## Introduction
According to the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change), Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sunâ€™s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, **human activities** have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms, and declining biodiversity.

## Problem Statement
It is important to determine the impacts of CO2 release in each African region.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Python**: Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- **Tableau**: Visualization

## Dataset
The dataset, IEA-EDGAR CO2, is a component of the EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) Community GHG database version 7.0 (2022) including or based on data from IEA (2021) Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Energy, www.iea.org/statistics, as modified by the Joint Research Centre. The data source was the EDGARv7.0_GHG website provided by Crippa et. al. (2022) and with DOI.

The dataset contains three sheets - IPCC 2006, 1PCC 1996, and TOTALS BY COUNTRY on the amount of CO2 (a greenhouse gas) generated by countries between 1970 and 2021. You can download the dataset from your workspace or inspect the dataset directly [here] (https://github.com/Esther-Aj/Climate-Change-In-Africa/blob/main/IEA_EDGAR_CO2_1970-2021.xlsx).

### TOTALS BY COUNTRY SHEET

This sheet contains the annual CO2 (kt) produced between 1970 - 2021 in each country. The relevant columns in this sheet are:

| Columns | Description |
| ------- | ------------|
| `C_group_IM24_sh` | The region of the world |
| `Country_code_A3` | The country code |
| `Name`            | The name of the country |
| `Y_1970 - Y_2021` | The amount of CO2 (kt) from 1970 - 2021 |


### IPCC 2006

These sheets contain the amount of CO2 by country and the industry responsible. 

| Columns | Description |
| ------- | ------------|
| `C_group_IM24_sh` | The region of the world |
| `Country_code_A3` | The country code |
| `Name`            | The name of the country |
| `Y_1970 - Y_2021` | The amount of CO2 (kt) from 1970 - 2021 |
| `ipcc_code_2006_for_standard_report_name` | The industry responsible for generating CO2 |
